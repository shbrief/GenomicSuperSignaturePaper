#### data/eSets/new/*   

All the files in this directory were downloaded from [here](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/crc-subtyping-paper/src/master/data/eSets/)
and processed with these scripts: [1-assign_cont_score](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/crc-subtyping-paper/src/master/src/1-assign_cont_score.R) and [3-assign_CMS](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/crc-subtyping-paper/src/master/src/3-assign_CMS.R).

and combined the scores from them into the phenoData of original ExpressionSet objects.

Miscellaneous functions from https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/crc-subtyping-paper/src/master/src/misc.R.
