## GenomicSuperSignaturePaper
Here, we are presenting the usecases and benchmarking examples of [GenomicSuperSignature](https://shbrief.github.io/GenomicSuperSignature/) R package.

### CRC paper
One of the benchmarking papers is [Continuity of transcriptomes among colorectal cancer subtypes based on meta-analysis](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1511-4). 

#### Continuous Subtype Score
Left panel is Figure 4A from CRC paper and right panel is the CRC subtype separation
by GenomicSuperSignature. CRC paper built the continuous score model based on the 8 
colorectal cancer specific microarray datasets with graph-based clustering method. 
However, GenomicSuperSignature was generated from 536 heterogeneous, RNA sequencing 
datasets and used hierarchical clustering. Despite of this major differences in 
model building process, GenomicSuperSignature could reproduce the CRC paper's result.

Detail on this reproducing process is described in [CRC/CRC subtype score](https://shbrief.github.io/GenomicSuperSignaturePaper/articles/CRC/repeat_Fig4A.html) 
tab.

#### Clinical Variables
Detail on this reproducing process is described in [CRC/CRC clinical variables](https://shbrief.github.io/GenomicSuperSignaturePaper/articles/CRC/repeat_Fig4C.html).

Below is Figure 4 from CRC paper. LRT (likelihood-ratio test) between the reference 
full model versus either the continuous scores only model or the discrete subtypes 
only model are plotted here. A p-value near 1 (âˆ’log10p-value near 0) suggests that 
no additional information is provided by the full model. 

This results shows that PCSS1/2 (the second *score* column) provide additional information 
in characterizing molecular/histological/clinical correlates than CMS (the first *subtype* column).

RAV834/833 also performs better than CMS subtypes.

We directly compared the performanace between PCSS and RAV. Except the tumor location 
(the last column), RAV834/833-based model out-performed PCSS1/2-based model relative
to the combined model.

### multiPLIER paper
The other benchmarking paper is [MultiPLIER: A Transfer Learning Framework for Transcriptomics Reveals Systemic Features of Rare Disease](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(19)30119-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS240547121930119X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). 

#### Neutrophil Counts/Estimates
The top panel is Figure 3 from multiPLIER paper and the bottom panel is the benchmark
example by GenomicSuperSignature. In multiPLIER paper, latent variables (LVs) were
built from recount2 datasets using [Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0456-1) method. Despite of the 
major differences in model building process, GenomicSuperSignature could reproduce 
the multiPLIER paper's result.

Detail on this reproducing process is described in [multiPLIER/Neutrophil (SLE-WB)](https://shbrief.github.io/GenomicSuperSignaturePaper/articles/SLE-WB/repeat_Fig3_SLE-WB.html) 
and [multiPLIER/Neutrophil (NARES)](https://shbrief.github.io/GenomicSuperSignaturePaper/articles/NARES/repeat_Fig3_NARES.html) tabs.

Fig 3 from multiPLIER paper: neutrophil-associated LV, LV603 shows the positive 
correlation with neutrophil counts/estimates of two different datasets, SLE WB 
and NARES.

We used the same datasets, SLE-WB and NARES, to find the neutrophil-associated RAV.
