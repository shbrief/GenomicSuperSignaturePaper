\title{Check a pair of pathways are captured in the signature model}
\usage{
checkPathwaySeparation(
  PCAmodel,
  pathway1,
  pathway2,
  cutoff_nes = NULL,
  cutoff_n = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PCAmodel}{PCAGenomicSignatures object.}

\item{pathway1}{A character vector. Keywords you are looking for.}

\item{pathway2}{A character vector. Keywords you are looking for.}

\item{cutoff_nes}{A minimum NES to be kept. Under the default (\code{NULL}), this
filter is not used.}

\item{cutoff_n}{A number of pathways to keep.Default is 5. If you don't want to
use this filter, assign it as \code{NULL}.}
}
\description{
Arguments \code{pathway1} and \code{pathway2} are character vectors containing
lists of pathways that you want to separate through the model.
